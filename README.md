# Tesla Companion

**Your all-in-one, web-based toolkit for viewing TeslaCam clips, estimating charging time, calculating phantom drain, and more.**  
This app is a single, self-contained HTML file that runs entirely in your browser for maximum privacy and portability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Camera Viewer**: Simultaneously view clips from all available cameras (Front, Back, Left/Right Repeaters, Left/Right Pillars) in a synchronized grid.
- **Seamless Event Playback**: Automatically groups 1-minute video files into a single, continuous event timeline and plays them back seamlessly without manual intervention.
- **Interactive Playback Controls**: Full playback controls including play/pause, a master scrubber, 5-second skips, and variable playback speed (0.25x to 4x).
- **Single-View Zoom**: Double-click any camera feed to expand it to full view. Double-click again to return to the grid layout.
- **Camera Toggling**: Customize your view by toggling individual camera feeds on or off.
- **Jump to Event**: If a Sentry or Dashcam event is detected, a button appears to jump directly to the moment of the trigger within the timeline.
- **In-App Map Viewer**: If an event contains GPS data, click the "Event Map" button to see the location on an embedded Google Map without leaving the page.
- **Enhanced Screenshots**: Capture a high-quality composite image of all visible camera feeds with a single click.
- **Charging Time Estimator**: Calculate how long a charging session will take based on your vehicle's battery capacity, current/target State of Charge (SoC), and charger type (including custom inputs).
- **Phantom Drain Estimator**:
  - *Time to Drain*: Estimate how long your battery will last while parked by setting a target drain percentage.
  - *Percentage Lost*: Calculate the expected battery percentage loss over a specific date and time range.
  - *Refined Calculations*: Both drain modes can be refined with inputs for battery health, outside temperature, and active auxiliary features (Sentry Mode, Summon Standby, etc.).
- **Light & Dark Modes**: A sleek, modern interface with automatic theme detection and manual toggling.
- **Fully Responsive & Keyboard Accessible**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers, with full keyboard shortcuts for core playback functions.
- **Privacy Focused**: No data ever leaves your computer. All file processing and calculations happen locally in your browser.
