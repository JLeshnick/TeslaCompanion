Tesla Companion
===============

Your all-in-one web-based toolkit for viewing TeslaCam clips, estimating charging time, calculating phantom drain, and more. This app is a single, self-contained HTML file that runs entirely in your browser.

‚ú® Features
----------

*   **Multi-Camera Viewer:** Simultaneously view clips from all cameras (Front, Back, Left/Right Repeaters, Left/Right Pillars) in a synchronized grid.
    
*   **Event-Based Grouping:** Automatically groups 1-minute video files into a single, continuous event timeline.
    
*   **Interactive Playback:** Full playback controls including play/pause, a master scrubber, 5-second skips, and variable playback speed.
    
*   **Single-View Zoom:** Double-click any camera feed to expand it to full view. Double-click again to return to the grid layout.
    
*   **Jump to Event:** If a Sentry or Dashcam event is detected, a button appears to jump directly to the moment of the trigger.
    
*   **Enhanced Screenshots:** Capture a high-quality composite image of all visible camera feeds with a single click.
    
*   **Charging Time Estimator:** Calculate how long a charging session will take based on battery capacity, SoC, and charger type (including custom inputs).
    
*   **Phantom Drain Estimator:** Estimate how long your battery will last while parked, based on active features like Sentry Mode and outside temperature.
    
*   **Light & Dark Modes:** A sleek, modern interface with theme toggling.
    
*   **Fully Responsive:** Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
    
*   **Privacy Focused:** No data ever leaves your computer. Everything is processed locally in your browser.

_(Note: To set this up for your own repository, go to Settings > Pages, and under "Build and deployment," select Deploy from a branch and choose the main branch with the /root folder.)_

üíª How to Use
-------------

1.  **View Sentry/Dashcam Clips:** Plug your Tesla's USB drive into your computer.
    
2.  **Launch the App:** Open the index.html file in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
