# Tesla Companion

Your all-in-one web-based toolkit for viewing TeslaCam clips, estimating charging time, calculating phantom drain, and more. This app is a single, self-contained HTML file that runs entirely in your browser.

## ‚ú® Features

- **In-App Map Viewer:** If an event contains GPS data, click the "Event Map" button to see the location on a map without leaving the page.
- **Enhanced Screenshots:** Capture a high-quality composite image of all visible camera feeds with a single click.
- **Charging Time Estimator:** Calculate how long a charging session will take based on battery capacity, SoC, and charger type (including custom inputs).
- **Phantom Drain Estimator:** Estimate how long your battery will last while parked, based on active features like Sentry Mode and outside temperature.

# üìö Reference

## Camera Indexes

The `event.json` file references cameras by a number. Here is the mapping used by this application:

| Index | Camera View     |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0     | Front           |
| 3     | Left Pillar     |
| 4     | Right Pillar    |
| 5     | Left Repeater   |
| 6     | Right Repeater  |
| 7     | Back            |

## Event Reasons

The `reason` field in the event file indicates what triggered the recording. Here are some common reasons:

|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sentry_aware_object_detection       | Sentry Mode detected an object or movement nearby.                      |
